# NiceNode

"A one-click-to-start Ethereum node"

<strong>Mission: </strong>2x the number of Ethereum nodes by making a one-click-to-start Ethereum node

<strong>Why?: </strong>The light client roadmap for Ethereum depends on access to reliable full nodes. Increasing the number and availability of full nodes is therefore important for the future of Ethereum.
